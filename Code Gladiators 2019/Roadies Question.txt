Find the subset of an array which has highest sum but the constraint is that no two numbers should have any digit in common.

Example:
Input : 121,23,3,333,4
Output: 458 
Explanation:
The numbers 121 , 333, 4 do not have any of the digits in common and they form the maximum sum
Hence, 121 + 333 + 4 = 458
