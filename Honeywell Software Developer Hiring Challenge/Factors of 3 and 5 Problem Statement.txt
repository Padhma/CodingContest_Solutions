A positive integer is defined as ideal if it can be expressed in the form, 3^x * 5^y for some non-negative integers x and y. Ideal integers have only 3 and 5 as prime divisors. The integers 15,45,75 are ideal integers but 6,10,21 are not.

Find the number of ideal-integers within the given segment [l,r] inclusive, i.e. the integers t such that l <= t <= r.

Constraints:
1 <= l <= r <= 2 * 10^9
